- We're going to talk about the online presentation of the questionnaire

**slide: who we are**

- We are Pauline and Daniel from the eResearch Centre at JCU
- we're building the online questionnaire system

**slide: aims**

- interacting with universities can be formal and impersonal
- that can turn away the people who most need the interaction
- we've aimed at *engagement* with:
	- conversational exchange
	- simple, comprehensible interaction
	- friendly presentation
	- clear communication

- ..and there's a demo of our solution online right now 

**slide: url**

- questionnaire dot now dot S H
- (click it)
- do demo:

	- [click: start demo] 
		- text shows up in talk bubbles
		- we've chosen an info icon avatar for us, and an abstract smiley for the user

	- [click: okay]
		- user responds by clicking or tapping their answer

	- [click: 3 or more]
		- choosing an answer directs the conversation along the relevant path

	- [click: okay]

	- [click: I do]
		- the conversation continues

	- [click: yes]
		- talk bubbles can include website and email links

 		- we can come back to this


[switch back to powerpoint]


- institutions can add, remove, and edit questions and answers

**slide: making it yours**

- we'd *like* to provide an online editing system, but can't in the time we have
- instead, the next fortnight or so we'll provide a spreadsheet for editing questions
- might not look exactly like this, but be broadly similar

- built into these questions are all the possible conversational directions

**slide: Flow diagram**

- we've found it convenient to review the conversational flow using flow diagrams like this
- on the left, too small to read, is the full flow of the demonstration questions
- zoomed in on the right is the top of that
- this diagram is linked from the top of the demo page if you want a good look at it

- lets's look at adapting the thing to fit your institution

**slide: Customisation**

- questions, answers, flow: spreadsheet we looked at earlier
- colours, fonts: custom CSS (your web team can write)
- header and footer: custom HTML (also your web team)
- avatars, PDF summaries, etc: provide them

**slide: Workflow**

- (talk through points)

- what's happening at the other end?

**slide: On the web**

- running in the NeCTAR cloud
	- NeCTAR is a government funded computing resource for research and education
- it's open source, so you can run it on an internal system if you want
- we expect to pass WCAG's AA accessibility rating

**slide: end**

- so that's what we're working on
- (questions?)
